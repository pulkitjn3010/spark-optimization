    "\n",
    "1. **Broadcast Join avoids shuffling**:\n",
    "    - No shuffle read/write → no skew → less memory/disk spill.\n",
    "    - All data from `df_customers` was broadcast (only 32.2 MiB).\n",
    "2. **Sort Merge Join is expensive**:\n",
    "    - High shuffle read/write → ~2.4 GiB in both directions.\n",
    "    - Significant skew (some tasks reading 1.1 GiB).\n",
    "    - Required sorting on both sides + high memory/disk usage.\n",
    "    - Worst task took 3.1 minutes.\n",
    "3. **Broadcast Join is more efficient for small dimension tables**:\n",
    "    - Avoids shuffle.\n",
    "    - Reduces execution time.\n",
    "    - Reduces memory pressure and GC time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Only 15 Tasks in Broadcast Join?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because only the **left side** (fact table) was partitioned and parallelized. The right side (`df_customers`) was broadcast and handled by the driver. So execution happens only across partitions of the left table (`df_transactions`, which probably has 15 partitions after your latest transformation)."

    "1. **Why high shuffle size for Sort-Merge Join?**\n",
    "    - SMJ requires both sides of the join to be **sorted** and **shuffled by join key** (`cust_id`). This causes **full data shuffles** on both sides (especially the large `transactions` DataFrame).\n",
    "2. **Why two exchanges?**\n",
    "    - One `Exchange` for sorting and shuffling `transactions`.\n",
    "    - One `Exchange` for sorting and shuffling `customers`.\n",
    "3. **Memory Pressure:**\n",
    "    - One of the sort stages spilled to disk (512 MB) — indicates **insufficient memory for sorting** some partitions.\n",
    "4. **Join Output:**\n",
    "    - You got ~40 million joined rows. Despite smaller `customers` table, Spark didn’t use Broadcast Join because auto broadcast was **disabled**.\n",
    "5. **Total execution time is high** due to:\n",
    "    - Large shuffle read/write (especially 2.4 GiB).\n",
    "    - Sorting overhead (spill to disk).\n",
    "    - 200 tasks running under memory pressure."
